# ReversiAI
**ReversiAI** is a AI program that plays the game Reversi (more commonly known as Othello) that I worked on during my AI for Games class at the University of Florida. All work done was in StudentAI/StudentAI.cs, where the program's AI algorithms were implemented.

## Usage
Open the project's in Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 and press Ctrl + F5 to start the program. You can change the AI algorithm being used by going to Game -> Options... -> Players and selecting the corresponding AI implementation for either Black or White. You can also pick 'User' instead for either option to play Reversi yourself against the chosen AI.

## Documentation & More Information
Please refer to the 'Manual - Reversi' PDF for information regarding the documentation around the API calls used.

This project took around 6-8 hours to complete, and was completed on March 23rd, 2020.
